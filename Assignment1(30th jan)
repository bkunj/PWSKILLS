5. Free and Open-Source
6. Vast Libraries Support
7. Portability
...etc

14.How is memory managed in Python?
Ans: Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures.
The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager.

15.How to install Python on Windows and set path variables?
Ans: Install python from this link https://www.python.org/downloads/
To set path variable these are following steps:
[Right Click]Computer > Properties >Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables
Click [New] under "System Variable"
Variable Name: PY_HOME, Variable Value:C:\path\to\python\version enter image description here
Click [OK]
Locate the "Path" System variable and click [Edit]
Add the following to the existing variable:
%PY_HOME%;%PY_HOME%\Lib;%PY_HOME%\DLLs;%PY_HOME%\Lib\lib-tk;
Click [OK] to close all of the windows.
Aa a final sanity check open a command prompt and enter python. You should see
>python [whatever version you are using]
